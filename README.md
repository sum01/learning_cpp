# Learning C++

Just a dumping ground for any C++ projects that I make while learning C++.

PS: [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com) is great :+1:

## Building

Depdencies: `cmake`, and any compatible C++ compiler.

Run `cmake` on the root `CMakeLists.txt`, or `cd build` and `cmake ..`, then compile the makefile with your OS's compiler.

The individual projects can also be built alone, without using the root `CMakeLists.txt`, since each one has its own `CMakeLists.txt`.
